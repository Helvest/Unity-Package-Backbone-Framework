# Unity Package: Helvest Framework

Helvest's framework for Unity, contains the necessary to easily implement the following Design Patterns: 
- Mediator
- [Service Locator](https://github.com/Helvest/Unity-Package-Service-Locator.git)
- [State Machine](https://github.com/Helvest/Unity-Package-Stype-Machine.git)

And also contains:
> A special State Machine named Type Machine, which uses Types as state indexes, and thus allows each state to be coded in an independent class by inheriting from **IState**.

> And finally, an extensible game manager, derived from Type Machine, to define the states of your game, while mediating between your other scripts.
